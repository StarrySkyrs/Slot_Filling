# Slot Filling and Intent Classification 

## Description:
We will build an end-to-end system for basic (binary) intent recognition and slot filling in the context of a dialogue system to find the restaurants and hotels that appear in the dialogues.

We'll be working with the MultiWOZ dataset of goal-oriented dialogues (2.2). You can look at the full corpus [here](https://github.com/budzianowski/multiwoz/tree/master/data/MultiWOZ_2.2). It has an impressively detailed annotation involving multiple turns and multiple goals, which we have simplified to just the initiating request (first turn) and involving two possible intents and the corresponding slots for those intents.
